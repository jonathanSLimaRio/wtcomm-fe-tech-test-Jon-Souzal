           <p>\n                If you'd like, you can use, change or extend components already\n                present in the ui library. Those we have included, are just a\n                wrapper around the Material UI one, nothing more. You can import\n                them in this way:\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                <CodeBlock>\n                  {\n                    \"import { Button, Progress } from '@mono-nx-test-with-nextjs/ui';\"\n                  }\n                </CodeBlock>\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Same thing for icons. They can be imported directly as a normal\n                component from the library as:\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                <CodeBlock>\n                  {\n                    \"import {VisibilityIcon} from '@mono-nx-test-with-nextjs/ui';\"\n                  }\n                </CodeBlock>\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                This is the list of the original Material UI components we\n                wrapped:\n              </p>\n              <ul>\n                {listOfAllowedComponents.map((componentName) => (\n                  <li key={componentName}>\n                    <ExternalLink\n                      href={`https://material-ui.com/components/${componentName}/`}\n                    >\n                      {componentName}\n                    </ExternalLink>\n                  </li>\n                ))}\n              </ul>\n              <p>You can also use Material UI Utils.</p>\n              <b>\n                <p>\n                  <b>\n                    Nothing else is allowed from Material UI or extra UI\n                    framework (i.e. Bootstrap).

We believe this is the best way to evaluate a\n        candidate because this is what you will do if you get the job.\n        Hopefully, you will find this test challenging and fun. We do appreciate\n        any feedback, good or bad you might have. Do not hesitate to let us know\n        what you think! Help us improve!\n      </p>\n      <p>Let's begin...</p>\n      <p>This codebase is a mono-repo. At the moment you will find:</p>\n      {ANSWERS && getInstructionsBasedOnFramework(ANSWERS?.framework)}\n      <p>\n        The FE application is already connected to the API (swagger below), so\n        you don't need to worry about that. But there is also a shared library\n        of components which you might want to use. Imagine this a real\n        situation, so when you create a new component, you need to think where\n        to put it. Does it belong to a share component library or in the\n        application?\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Remember, the API is not persistent, so every time you make a change\n        with PUT etc. it will be saved until you restart.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <b>\n          Somebody should have told you which test to do, if you are not sure,\n          please reach out to your recruiter and ask.\n        </b>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We are expecting people at any level to be able to delivery any of the\n        below tests. There is no time limit, so you can relax and get it done\n        when you can, it will take you only a few hours. The actual\n        implementation will help us to assess your level more accurately. If we\n        do not like your implementation or how you code and you fail the test,\n        this doesn't make you a bad coder, it is just our own opinion, don't\n        take it personally, we can also make mistakes.\n      </p>\n      <h2>\n        {testNumber\n          ?
